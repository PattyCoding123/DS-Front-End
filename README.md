# DS-Front-End
These Python files are a part of a personal Data Science project where I am utilizing data analysis libraries in Python to create my own data-driven website.
The data analysis libraries that I use include pandas and Streamlit. I will be making methods in order to extract the data, and then use some features from the libraries in order to display the data in a more structured way, and I want to experience with the various features of each library to enhance the "data-driven" aspect of the app.
